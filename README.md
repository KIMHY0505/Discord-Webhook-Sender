 #Discord - Webhook Sender

After setting up using "npm i",
 you can execute and build the program using "npm start",
and for building specifically for Windows 64-bit, use "npm run build:win-x64".

Before building and debugging the program, please add your webhook link to the "WebHookURL.txt" file.

You can remove the test webhook I have added and insert your own. Please contact B_B#3091 on Discord if you need further assistance.
